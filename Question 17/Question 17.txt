In Namespace project-tiger create a Pod named tigers-reunite of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine with labels pod=container and container=pod. Find out on which node the Pod is scheduled. Ssh into that node and find the docker container(s) belonging to that Pod.

Write the docker IDs of the container(s) and the process/command these are running into /opt/course/17/pod-container.txt.

Finally write the logs of the main docker container (from the one you specified in your yaml) into /opt/course/17/pod-container.log using the docker command.
