Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H

The metrics-server hasn't been installed yet in the cluster, but it's something that should be done soon. Your college would already like to know the kubectl commands to:

show node resource usage
show Pod and their containers resource usage
Please write the commands into /opt/course/7/node.sh and /opt/course/7/pod.sh.
