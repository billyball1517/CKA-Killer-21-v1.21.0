Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC

Node cluster2-worker1 has been added to the cluster using kubeadm and TLS bootstrapping.

Find the "Issuer" and "Extended Key Usage" values of the cluster2-worker1:

kubelet client certificate, the one used for outgoing connections to the kube-apiserver.
kubelet server certificate, the one used for incoming connections from the kube-apiserver.
Write the information into file /opt/course/23/certificate-info.txt.

Compare the "Issuer" and "Extended Key Usage" fields of both certificates and make sense of these.
