Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c3-CCC

Make a backup of etcd running on cluster3-master1 and save it on the master node at /tmp/etcd-backup.db.

Then create a Pod of your kind in the cluster.

Finally restore the backup, confirm the cluster is still working and that the created Pod is no longer with us.
