Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c3-CCC

Create a Static Pod named my-static-pod in Namespace default on cluster3-master1. It should be of image nginx:1.16-alpine and have resource requests for 10m CPU and 20Mi memory.

Then create a NodePort Service named static-pod-service which exposes that static Pod on port 80 and check if it has Endpoints and if its reachable through the cluster3-master1 internal IP address. You can connect to the internal node IPs from your main terminal.
