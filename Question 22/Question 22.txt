Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC

Check how long the kube-apiserver server certificate is valid on cluster2-master1. Do this with openssl or cfssl. Write the exipiration date into /opt/course/22/expiration.

Also run the correct kubeadm command to list the expiration dates and confirm both methods show the same date.

Write the correct kubeadm command that would renew the apiserver server certificate into /opt/course/22/kubeadm-renew-certs.sh.
